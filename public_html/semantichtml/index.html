            <h2>PERSISTENCE</h2>
             <p>is an essential factor in the procedure of transmuting
            <i>DESIRE</i> into its monetary equivalent. The basis of persistence is the 
            <em>POWER OF WILL</em>.</p>

            </figure>
             
            <p>Will-power and the desire, when properly combined, make an irresistible
            pair. Men who accumulate great fortunes are generally know as cold-blooded, and 
            sometimes ruthless. Often they are misunderstood. What they have is will-power,
            which they mix with persistence, and place back of their desires to insure the 
            attainment of their objectives.</p>
            
            <p>Henry Ford has been generally misunderstood to be ruthless and cold-blooded.
             This misconception grew out of Ford's habits of following trough in all of his
            plans with <i>PERSISTENCE</i>.</p>
            
            <p>The majority of people are ready to throw their aims and purposes overboard,
            and give up at the first sign of opposition or misfortune. A few carry on DESPITE
            all opposition, until they attain their goal. These few are Fords, Carnegies, 
            Rockefellers,  and Edisons.</p>

            <h3 style="display: none">ESto es una prueba!!!!!!!!!!</h3>
            
            
            <p>There may be no heroic connotation to the word <q>persistence,</q> and the 
            quality is to the character of man what carbon is to steel.</p>
            
            <p>Persistence is  state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated. <br> Like all
            states of mind , persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:-</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.</strong> Knowing what one wants is the 
                first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence.
                A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties.</li>
                
                <li><strong>DESIRE.</strong> It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain
                persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire.</li>
                
                <li><strong>DEFINITENESS OF PLANS.</strong> Organized plans, even though they be 
                weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence.</li> 
                
                <li><strong>ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE.</strong> Knowing that one's plans are sound, based
                upon experience or observation, encourages persistence; <q>guessing</q> instead of 
                <q>knowing</q> destroys persistence.</li>
                
                <li><b>CO-OPERATION.</b> Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with 
                others tend to develop persistence.</li>
                
                <li><b>WILL-POWER.</b> The habit of concentrating one's thoughts upon the building
                of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose, leads to persistence.</li>
                
                <li><b>HABIT.</b> Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and 
                becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds.</li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <p>Before leaving the subject of <i>PERSISTENCE</i>, take inventory of yourself, and
            determine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this essential quality.
            Measure yourself courageously, point by point and see how many of the eight factors
            of persistence you lack. The analysis may lead to discoveries  that will give you a 
            new on yourself.</p>
